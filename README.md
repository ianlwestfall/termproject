# METCS601: Term Project
# Portfolio Site

This is my portfolio site built in React with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

(no other languages, libraries, or frameworks)
***I did need to use gh-pages to get my site up on Github Pages

# Features

- Home page with an introduction and links to my linkedin and github
- ***Home page also has a "secret" drag and drop feature you should try out
- About page with a little more personal info about me and a tv/book recommendation
- An education page using grid to display some classes information
- education info is stored in a JSON and pulled in for easy updating and addition
- projects page with a download link to an alpha APK of a passphrase generator I did for another class
- contact page with a form to fill out that is validated (obviously can't actually send an email without server-side coding)
- scroll to top button on pages that have a scroll bar
- flex and @media used in a lot of CSS to make page responsive to smaller resolutions
